    "This lab aims to introduce you to the network layer of the Internet protocol suite. In particular, you will set up and analyze a routing protocol, Network Address Translation (NAT), and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n",

    "[Figure 1](#figure_1) shows the setup for this lab. It is an extension to lab2, but the servers now have public IP addresses and two other private networks. Your job is to configure a routing protocol in the routers to have full connectivity between the networks and to set up NAT to access the servers from the private networks. Additionally, you will set up DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients in private networks.\n",

    "To have connectivity, you need to update the routing tables with the correct paths to forward packets. You can do this using either static or dynamic routing:\n",

    "- In dynamic routing, you configure a routing protocol instructing routers to exchange information with other routers, then automatically learn routes and update the routing table.\n",

    "In this lab., we will use OSPF as an example, but using any other routing protocol is straightforward. [OSPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First) is a link-state routing protocol in which routers describe their link-state in a message called link-state advertisement (LSA). Then each router constructs a topology map of the network and calculates the shortest path using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)\n",
